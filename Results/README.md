This directory houses the results for the Dhrystone benchmark as ran on the Pico, Pi B 1 and Zero W. 
The Longbottom results show the DMIPS (aka VAX MIPS) for the Pi 1 as gathered by Roy Longbottom 
(http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/dhrystone%20results.htm#anchorAndroid). I wasn't able to repeat these results on
the Pi 1 and Zero W, perhaps due to differences in OS/test set-up, so I have included them in a seperate graph. Either
way, both sets of results show the overclocked Pico getting a higher DMIPS score, with the only point of contention
being whether the Pico is faster than a Pi 1 at 1000 MHz (should be equivalent to a Zero).
